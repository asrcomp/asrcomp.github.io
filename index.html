The event provided an exciting platform for students to develop and showcase their data science and cybersecurity skills.

Our students had a great time tackling the training challenges. For the Finals, they collaborated in teams of four, working closely together to solve complex cybersecurity problems under time constraints. The competition was intense and challenging, pushing the students to apply their knowledge and teamwork effectively.

Among the competing teams from various institutions, one of our ASRJC teams distinguished itself by securing 10th place, a commendable achievement given the high level of competition. This result reflects the dedication, skill, and collaborative spirit of our Computing students as they engaged deeply with real-world cyber defense scenarios.

Overall, Cyberthon 2025 was a rewarding experience that not only tested our students' technical abilities but also fostered camaraderie and a passion for cybersecurity, preparing them for future challenges in the digital domain.<br><br>
